# Cube Chase

Cube Chase is a game i made to teach my class how Unity3D works. 
This game was designed to give a better explanation of how Gameobjects and Scripts work together. 

While i was designing this game, i tried to take into account the many aspects that go into a games development. This include subjects such as User Interface, some basic Enemy AI, basic Player Movement, some Object Collection and Player stats such as Health and Movement Speed.
